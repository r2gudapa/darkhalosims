# darkhalosims
 Automatic Simulation Processing Program for Dark Matter Halos in N-body Simulations

This program was created by Rishita Gudapati for the F18/W19 offering of PHYS 437 by the University of Waterloo under the supervision of Dr James Taylor
Documentation can be found in the accompanying report submitted for credit in PHYS 437B

This program may produce errors in the automatic fit of halos to NFW profiles - further testing is required.
The halo location and automatic snapshot processing features work well.
